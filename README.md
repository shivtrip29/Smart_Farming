# Smart_Farming

## Brief Description
This repository contains the code and circuits for a smart farming system using IoT. The circuits are simulated in Proteus Design Suite and artificial conditions are simulated using python. The system also comprises of an application that finally outputs the data and provides the farmer with an insight regarding his farmland. 

## Systems Implemented
- Automatic irrigation based on soil moisture
- Crop suggestion using Deep Learning
- Natural disaster alert
- Fertiliser prediction
- Soil quality monitoring 

## Tech Stack
- Proteus Design Suite
- Arduino
- Python
- Google Firebase
- Bravo Studio
- Figma

## Libraries Used
### For Arduino
DHT (Adafruit Sensor Library): Version 1.1.1

### For Python
ipinfo : To get the location of user from IP Address  
random : To generate random values for the proteus circuit
